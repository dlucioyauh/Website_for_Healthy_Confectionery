## Introduction

Welcome to the project for developing a website for the Healthy Artisan Confectionery, using JavaScript and other web technologies. This project is developed in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

- `src`: The folder containing the project's source files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possible static assets like images.
- `lib`: The folder for maintaining project dependencies.

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open the `.vscode/settings.json` file and update the related settings.

- `index.html`: The homepage of the site, providing a brief introduction to the confectionery and its products.
- `produtos.html`: A page dedicated to displaying the products available for purchase.
- `cadastro.html`: A page for customer registration, for those interested in ordering products from the confectionery.
- `carrinho.html`: A page displaying the items selected by the customer for purchase, with an option to finalize the order.
